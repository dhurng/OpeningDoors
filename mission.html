                We believe in making an impact in the world. </br>

Everything we do, we find some of the most needy and vulnerable individuals and help them in one of the most impactful ways possible. 

We just happen to do that by providing low income, traditionally underachieving, special education high school students in the inner city with free in class tutoring.

						<p>“Yes, the tutors were too patient and too kind, its that good. They have helped me get A and B in my classes, I improved very well in academics and I further more continue to improve. It helps me get my stuff done, if I don’t understand the material at all or not fully comprehend the material then I don’t know how to do it. It helped me get through a lot of this, usually I talk a lot and I don’t have time to get this done on time, plus I have IEP which stops me from moving onto certain objectives when I have others. So it can expand and grow to be from a little company to a big franchise.

						<p>“The tutors are critical in the education of the student’s welfare due to the extra individual help they can get. Within the special ed environment, the more one on one a student can get, the progress of education will only get better. The tutor that comes into class is great with the kids and shows patience, common knowledge, and pride in what he does with my students.”</p>

						<p>“The tutors were extremely kind and acknowledged the things we need, they have extreme patience with us. I actually started off with an F in the beginning of the year when you guys started this company it brought my grade up so much to an A that I have no idea what I would do without you guys.  Other programs don’t have the patience for special ed students like me, since I’m dyslexic I take more time reading and need more time explaining. I really want to see this program to grow so other students at other school will have the chance of having this pleasure.

			      	“I have seen an improvement in both written assignments and math assignments/ test scores as a direct result of tutoring intervention. Students receiving the same services and taking the math course has struggled with assignments on their own but improved with tutoring help. The program shows up consistently enough to build rapport with students to make a difference.”</p>
